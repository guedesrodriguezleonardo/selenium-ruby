# selenium-ruby ⛩️

This project is an automated testing framework that utilizes Selenium, RSpec, and Ruby to perform web application testing. The primary objective is to perform automated tests on Google's search engine and validate the results returned.

## Project structure
### 🗐 Page Object Pattern
This project utilizes the Page Object Pattern, which is a design pattern used to organize and structure automated tests. It separates the code for interacting with a web page from the code for the tests themselves. This approach makes tests easier to read, maintain, and extend.
